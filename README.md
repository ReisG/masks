# Looking for files matched with mask
Hello and welcome. Today we are going to see one of algorithms that can help find all files that matches one mask.
## Probable time complexity
O(s^(2n^2-n)) = O(s^n), where s - number of used symbols, n - maximum filename length
## What is mask
Mask is a sequence of symbols that can help to define a range of files. This sequences can contain letters, numbers, underscores... QUESTIONS and STARS.
